# Codes
This is the repository for the paper "Enhancing the DATF Technique in Differential-Linear Cryptanalysis". We provide the source codes of the DATF technique, which can estimate biases and verify our results. All of these source codes can be executed directly. The use of OpenMP enables the program to be parallelized.
